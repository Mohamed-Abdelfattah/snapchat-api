app flow after getting the access token

- any agent/browser will hit the url of the website
- for any request to the flask server a check for the access token should run and run a refresh expiry and run a function to refresh token and save it into environmental variable if needed
- flask server will then send the html of index page
- the frontend will responsible for sending requests to the flask endpoints that will connect to the snapchat api

- for the random users:

  - generate random users with faker
  - display on the frontend
  - save the list to text file
    - this text file will work as database
    - each file represents a data of the segment
    - named as "data", located in the folder that have the segment name (user can save and edit segment name)
    - should be updated whenever the user modifies the data
    -

What I done:

- tested all the endpoints to the snapchat api and kinda figured how they work
- created and committed feature: generating random list of users

---

what i need todo:

- save the generated random list in a folder on the backend in the segments folder, that folder should be named using a name that user can edit on the frontend:
  to solve the problem of duplicate folder names i plan to use the id that will be generated by the snapchat-api to construct the folder name using format "{list name} +++ {list id from snapchat}"
